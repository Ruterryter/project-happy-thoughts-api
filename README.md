# Project Happy Thoughts API

In this project I built an Api with Express and MongoDb to fetch and post data and then put it together with a previous frontend project, a twitter like page where you could post only happy thoughts. 

## Things I learnt 
- How to build a full API which includes handling of user input
- How to include error handling to return good validation errors
- How to build an API which works well with an existing frontend

## Tech used in this project
MongoDB
Mongoose
Express
JavaScript ES6
Heroku 

## View it live
